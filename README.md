# Constraint Utils
An easier way to add, remove and edit constraints and another ConstraintLayout properties;

## Install
Add this dependency from jCenter:
```gradle
compile 'UPDATE`PACKAGE`N`VERSION`HERE'
```

## Usage

### 1. Import the extension

```kotlin
import com.faogustavo.constraint.utils.modify
```
### 2. Call this function on your Constraint Layout
```kotlin
constraintLayout.modify {
    // Do your changes here
}
```

### 3. Modify your view
```kotlin
constraintLayout.modify {
    on(backgroundImage) {
        bottomToBottomOf(this.parent)
    }

    on(title) {
        unbind(ConstraintViewEditor.Side.LEFT)
        rightToLeftOf(this.parent, 16.dp)
    }

    on(description) {
        unbind(ConstraintViewEditor.Side.BOTTOM)
        topToBottomOf(this.parent)
    }

                    ...
}
```

### 4 Animate the changes if you want
```kotlin
constraintLayout.modify {
    
                    ...

    // Use the default transition type
    animated()

    // Or use a custom one
    val transition = ChangeBounds().apply {
        interpolator = BounceInterpolator()
        duration = 1200
    }
    withTransition(transition)
}
```


## Functions

### **On the ConstraintLayout**
### `modify (block: ConstraintEditor.() -> Unit)`
This is the simple way to start a modification on your constraint layout. Inside the block, you will have access to functions that allows you to modificate your view/views and animate the transaction;

### `modify (layoutId: Int, block: ConstraintEditor.() -> Unit)`
This is another way to start a modification. Passing the layout id as parameter allow you to clone the constraints from another layout;

### **On the ConstraintEditor context**
### `on(view: View, block: ConstraintViewEditor.() -> Unit)`
Start to modify a child view from a constraint layout;

### `on(viewId: int, block: ConstraintViewEditor.() -> Unit)`
Same from the method above, but using the ID instead of the view;

### `animated()`
Use the basic animation on the update from the view constraints;

### `withTransition(transition: Transition)`
Use a custom transition to animate the changes. You can also use a transition set. See the [Transition docs](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/transition/Transition);

### **On the ConstraintViewEditor context**
### `parent` attribute
This attribute from the ConstraintViewEditor is the ID of the constraint layout (_aka_ parent of inner views);

### `unbind(size: ConstraintViewEditor.Side)`
Remove one or more constraints from the view. Calling without a parameter will remove all constraints;

### `topToTopOf(anotherView: View, margin: Int)` and `topToTopOf(anotherView: Int, margin: Int)`
Bind the top of the editing view to the top of anotherView;

### `topToBottomOf(anotherView: View, margin: Int)` and `topToBottomOf(anotherView: Int, margin: Int)`
Bind the top of the editing view to the bottom of anotherView;

### `bottomToBottomOf(anotherView: View, margin: Int)` and `bottomToBottomOf(anotherView: Int, margin: Int)`
Bind the bottom of the editing view to the bottom of anotherView;

### `bottomToTopOf(anotherView: View, margin: Int)` and `bottomToTopOf(anotherView: Int, margin: Int)`
Bind the bottom of the editing view to the top of anotherView;

### `leftToLeftOf(anotherView: View, margin: Int)` and `leftToLeftOf(anotherView: Int, margin: Int)`
Bind the left of the editing view to the left of anotherView;

### `leftToRightOf(anotherView: View, margin: Int)` and `leftToRightOf(anotherView: Int, margin: Int)`
Bind the left of the editing view to the right of anotherView;

### `rightToRightOf(anotherView: View, margin: Int)` and `rightToRightOf(anotherView: Int, margin: Int)`
Bind the right of the editing view to the right of anotherView;

### `rightToLeftOf(anotherView: View, margin: Int)` and `rightToLeftOf(anotherView: Int, margin: Int)`
Bind the right of the editing view to the left of anotherView;

### `alignVerticalWith(anotherView: View)` and `alignVerticalWith(anotherView: Int)`
Bind the top and bottom from the editing view to the top and bottom from the anotherView;

### `alignHorizontalWith(anotherView: View)` and `alignVerticalWith(anotherView: Int)`
Bind the left and right from the editing view to the left and right from the anotherView;

### `width(width: Int)`
Sets a specific width to the view;

### `height(height: Int)`
Sets a specific height to the view;

### `parentWidth()`
Matchs the width with the parents width;

### `parentHeight()`
Matchs the height with the parents height;

### `widthMatchConstraint()`
Makes the view width the maximum allowed by the constraints;

### `heightMatchConstraint()`
Makes the view height the maximum allowed by the constraints;

### `widthWrapContent()`
Makes the view width the minimum necessary by the view;

### `heightWrapContent()`
Makes the view height the minimum necessary by the view;

### `minWidth(width: Int)`
Determines a minimum width to the view;

### `minHeight(height: Int)`
Determines a minimum height to the view;

### `maxWidth(width: Int)`
Determines a maximum width to the view;

### `maxHeight(height: Int)`
Determines a maximum height to the view;

### `rotation(rotation: Float)`
Set the views rotation. Rotation should be from 0 to 360;

### `verticalBias(bias: Float)`
Set the bias from the view. Bias should be from 0 to 1;

### `horizontalBias(bias: Float)`
Set the bias from the view. Bias should be from 0 to 1;

### `setRatio(ratio: String)`
Set the ratio from the view. Width or height sould (at least one of them) must be matchConstraint; Value should be in this format: `width:height`. eg: 4:3;

### `setElevation(elevation: Float)`
Set the view elevation;

### `circleTo(anotherView: View, angle: Float, radius: Int)` and `circleTo(anotherView: Int, angle: Float, radius: Int)`
Align this view in a circle position to another one. The angle should be between 0 and 360;

### `centerCircleWithIdTo(othersViews: List<View>, radius: Int, rangeInitial: Int, rangeFinal: Int)` and `centerCircleWithIdTo(anothersViews: List<Int>, radius: Int, rangeInitial: Int, rangeFinal: Int)`
Distribuite the views equally in the range defined. The initial and final range position must be between 0 and 360.
